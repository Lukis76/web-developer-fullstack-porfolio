Sequelize, a widely used ORM (Object Relational Mapping) library for Node.js is embraced by developers who work with different SQL databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and SQL Server. It provides a promise-based API to perform CRUD operations, transactions, associations, validations, and more on your database tables using JavaScript or TypeScript objects.

In this blog post. We will explore how to integrate Sequelize with TypeScript. By the end of this blog you will get a firm grasp on how to utilize Sequelize alongside TypeScript in order to develop dependable and sustainable APIs.

So grab your laptops, open your IDEs, and lets start on this exciting journey!

### Pre-requisites
Before we start exploring how to use Sequelize ORM with TypeScript, let us make sure you have everything you need installed and set up.

It is necessary to ensure that Node.js is properly installed on your computer. This is because Sequelize is built for Node.js applications, and it’s a requirement for running the ORM. Visit the official website of Node.js and proceed latest version of the software.

Next, we will be using the npm package manager for our dependencies. Yarn is a fast and reliable package manager that’s becoming increasingly popular in the JavaScript ecosystem. Make sure you have it installed on your system before continuing.

Finally, you will require a IDE or text editor. There are many great options available but VS code has many useful extensions that can enhance your coding experience and productivity.
